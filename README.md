# Tic-Tac-Toe
### A Tic-Tac-Toe game for the cmd written in C<br>
<br>
This is a mini-project written in C for the Unix Terminal. The size of the board is variable,<br>
and the only real way to exit a game halfwy through is to force it with CTRL + C.<br>
<br>
to run it on your own machine, download and compile the source code.<br>
